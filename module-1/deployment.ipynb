    "- Allows creation of agent workflows \n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph API` —\n",
    "- Bundles the graph code \n",
    "- Provides a task queue for managing asynchronous operations\n",
    "- Offers persistence for maintaining state across interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph Cloud` --\n",
    "- Hosted service for the LangGraph API\n",
    "- Allows deployment of graphs from GitHub repositories\n",
    "- Also provides monitoring and tracing for deployed graphs\n",
    "- Accessible via a unique URL for each deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph Studio` --\n",
    "- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for LangGraph applications\n",
    "- Uses the API as its back-end, allowing real-time testing and exploration of graphs\n",
    "- Can be run locally or with cloud-deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph SDK` --\n",
    "- Python library for programmatically interacting with LangGraph graphs\n",
    "- Provides a consistent interface for working with graphs, whether served locally or in the cloud\n",
    "- Allows creation of clients, access to assistants, thread management, and execution of runs\n",

    "Since the filming of these videos, we've updated Studio so that it can be run locally and opened in your browser. This is now the preferred way to run Studio (rather than using the Desktop App as shown in the video). See documentation [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/#local-development-server) on the local development server and [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/local-studio/#run-the-development-server). To start the local development server, run the following command in your terminal in the `/studio` directory in this module:\n"
